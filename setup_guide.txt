Rule: Don't try to create any ANALOGIES of any RL concept from ML and DL knowledge :)






Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
=======================================

Reinforcement Learning is a branch of ML that focuses on HOW an AGENT can learn to make DECISIONS and take ACTIONS in an ENVIRONMENT to maximize the chances of getting REWARDS.


RL is all about ACTION and REACTION.

Agent ------------------------------------> Environment

Agent learns via interacting with the environment.


Example:

Goal: Train a dog to fetch the ball.
------------------------------------
Agent: Dog
Environment: Dog Trainer | Ball | Backyard
Reward Mechanism:

if action == "Fetch":
	Dog Trainer will give a COOKIE(Reward)
else:
	Dog Trainer will give NOTHING (Penalty)


Common RL Terminologies
=======================

1. Agent: The one who perform ACTION and interact with the ENVIRONMENT

2. Environment: Its the agent's world. The environment is responsible to 
	
	a. Monitor Agent's action.
	b. Provide necessary feedback (Reward/Penalty) based on the action performed by the agent

3. Action: A valid activity in a given environment performed by an agent.

4. State/Observation: Current Position of the Agent and All Valid Positions in an Environment. 

5. Reward: A feedback offered by the environment to the agent based on agent's STATE and ACTION

6. Episode: List of events performed by an agent until termination condition is achieved



Steps to setup local lab environment
====================================
1. Download and install Anaconda Python
2. Download and install VSCode

3. Create Python Environment inside VSCode for the project
	- Create a folder in Desktop named RLDemos
	- Open cmd (Command Prompt from RLDemos folder)
	- Open VSCode via cmd using the command
		code .



4. Open Terminal (Terminal > New Terminal)
5. Inside Terminal perform the following commands,

	conda create -p rlvenv python==3.12

5. Create requirements.txt inside project folder
6. Add the following packages inside requirements.txt
	gymnasium
	pygame

7. Install dependencies using requirements.txt
	
	pip install -r requirements.txt (Run this command inside Terminal of project vscode)

8. Install ipykernel

	pip install ipykernel

9. Create a new file in project named RLTerminologiesDemo.ipynb 
10. Connect Kernel to the Notebook 

11. Try Running any Python Code to check if the notebook is executing python code or not
	e.g. 2+3
